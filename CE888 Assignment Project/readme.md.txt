##  This notebook is an implementation of the work shown in the paper :



***Using Regression to predict the Heart Diseases ::*** 
This is a task of prediction, where the aim is to predict 
the heart diseases with distinguish parameters such as age, chol, ca, 
thal, and etc., by using machine learning algorithms. 
Collected from [UCI ML repository]
***Original dataset :***
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
***A comparision of four methods has been done ::***

* ***Support Vector Regression***
* ***Decision Trees***
* ***Random Forest***
* ***Logistic Regression***
First of all data exploration will be done by using the dataset given above. 
Then built the model using distinguish machine learning algorithms. 
After modelling, model will be tested with several parameters.
