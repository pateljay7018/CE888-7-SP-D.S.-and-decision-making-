# Lung CT-based Classification for Covid-19-vs
 Non Covid-19

## Introduction
From 2019 to 2021 the corona virus known as covid-19 will have a wide range of effects on
human life. Viruses are extremely difficult to detect in their infancy. We used multi-class
classification to accomplish this. Using Deep CNN to detect this disease automatically was
demonstrated in this paper. With a classification accuracy of 95.83 percent, the neural network
is the best. Covid-19 images can thus be detected with the modelâ€™s help.## Baseline results:

#### Comparative Table for accuracy

| Metrics | Feature extractor transfer learning | Fine tuning transfer learning | Our Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Val Accuracy: | 0.74 | 0.91 | 0.95 |
| Train Accuracy: | 0.88 | 0.99 | 0.99 |
| Test Accuracy:  | 0.84 | 0.88 | 0.96 |

## Conclusion
To improve the accuracy of covid-19 prediction using CT-scan and x-ray reports, a Neural
Network machine learning algorithm is used in the proposed work. It was found that 95.83
percent of predictions were accurate when using the NN algorithm According to the results of
further research, KNN algorithm outperforms others and can be used to detect cases. Large
datasets from additional datasets with a larger number of networks can be included in the
technique. The accuracy of forecasts can be improved by combining algorithms.
